    <p style="color: ghostwhite;"> MedoPill is a pill remainder application which is constructed using XML for frontend and Java for backend.
        Most of the people are forget to intake their medicine due to their work pressure and other personal reasons.
        This leads to the critical stage of their illness. To help over them, MedoPill is designed. This project
        represents the advancement in the medical field as the application mainly deals with the pill remainder.
        Many pill reminders are based on hardware implementation. Due to the mobile, our project is purely based on
        software. Our feature in this application is that the patient and guardian details are mentioned so that if
        any emergency cases, it intimates to the particular guardian.  And also if the pill gets over, 
        a notification is given to the patients about the present scenario. According to the current location, 
        nearby medical shops are being listed out for their convenience. The remainder is set in the form of 
        alarm every time. The system also consists of a good user interface and highly secured, low cost,
        user-friendly and time-consuming.
